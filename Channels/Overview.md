# OpenClaw Channels - Overview

OpenClaw can talk to you on any chat app you already use. Each channel connects via the Gateway.
Text is supported everywhere; media and reactions vary by channel.

## Supported Channels

- **Telegram** — Bot API via grammY; supports groups.
- **Discord** — Discord Bot API + Gateway; supports servers, channels, and DMs.

## Notes

- Channels can run simultaneously; configure multiple and OpenClaw will route per chat.
- Fastest setup is usually Telegram (simple bot token). WhatsApp requires QR pairing and stores more state on disk.
- Group behavior varies by channel; see [Groups](./groups.md).
- DM pairing and allowlists are enforced for safety; see [Security](./security.md).
- Telegram internals: [grammY notes](./grammy-notes.md).
- Troubleshooting: [Channel troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md).
- Model providers are documented separately; see [Model Providers](/providers/models).
